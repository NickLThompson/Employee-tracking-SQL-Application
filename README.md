## Description

This program is designed to create a database for a company. 

Specifically, a database that shows what departments there are,

what employees they have, and each employee's role. The owner 

can also add departments, add roles, add employees, and update

employees.


## Usage

The usage of this program is to be able to keep an evolving database

for a company to be able to visually see a layout of their company 

departments, roles, and employees; Along with specifics such as 

who manages who, the salary of each position, and other small details.

## Status

The status of this program was unfortunately a failure. I happen to quite

like mySQL, but I struggled with one specific error code that totally had 

my attention all weekend, but eventually my instructor, Anthony, got with me

and helped me out in 5 minutes. Because it was the weekend, I wasn't really

able to solve this issue until it was too late, but I'm still somewhat happy 

with the outcome. I know that I'm close to having this done properly, and given

a few more days I think I'll be able to wrap this up nicely and resubmit with a

more successful program. That's the plan, anyway!
